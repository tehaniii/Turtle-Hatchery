     <b><p>Making the world better for us and the small creatures living with us by giving back together.</p><br></b>
     <p>Sri Lanka has a diversified sea turtle population, with five of the world's seven sea turtle species present in its seas. These turtles are a vital element of Sri Lanka's marine environment, helping to keep the ecosystem healthy and balanced. They help to manage the
       population of their victims, such as jellyfish and sponges, by servine as an indicator of the health of the marine environment.<br></p>

          <h3>Who we are</h3>
          <p>Our hatchery was established with the intention of boosting sea turtle numbers and provide a secure 
            environment for hatchlings to develop and flourish. We are devoted to the preservation and protection 
            of sea turtles at our turtle hatchery. We are a group of committed individuals working together to change 
            the conservation landscape by spreading knowledge and taking action.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We hope to inspire the next generation of conservationists and increase public awareness about the dangers
               affecting sea turtles through our educational initiatives. Our turtle hatchery is dedicated to advancing 
               conservation efforts and building a brighter future for sea turtles and their natural habitats.</p>

          <h3>What we do</h3>
          <p>By the implementation of several conservation projects, including as nest monitoring, egg protection, and 
            hatchling release into the ocean, we tirelessly seek to preserve these wonderful sea turtles. With our outreach
             and education programs, we also hope to spread the word about the value of sea turtle conservation and inspire 
             others to join us in our efforts.</p>

             <p>Our hatchery was founded with the goal of protecting and conserving sea turtles and their habitats, and we 
              have been working towards this mission ever since.We also believe that awareness and education are crucial to the long-term sustainability of sea turtle conservation,
               which is why we are committed to informing people about the issue and encouraging them to take action.</p>
